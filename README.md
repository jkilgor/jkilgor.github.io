## Downtime Pursuits

#### Books

Whenever I find a free moment, I lose myself in the pages of a good book. Reading has always been a passion of mine. Back in middle school, I was so devoted to my literary adventures that I would often skip lunch just to steal away with my book of the day. In those carefree days, I could devour 3 to 4 books in a single day and finish  8 to 10 over the weekend. My enthusiasm was so great that I ended up breaking several backpacks; the weight of my books proved too much for them to bear! My mom dreaded hearing that I finished another book because it always meant I wanted another two-hour trip to the library. <br>

My favorite genres are Sci-Fi and Fantasy by far, though lately everything has been mostly romance-based, but still with that romance flavor. Recently, I have expanded my flavor profile by getting into LITRPGS and Asian Web novels or light novels. Light novels, for those who don’t know, are essentially the fully written version of manga or anime, as they don’t typically contain any kind of visual art. I find that I go through material too quickly to really enjoy manga.  You can find published official versions of light or web novels anywhere you can purchase books, typically, but there’s a site that compiles translations done by fans and smaller groups. I’ll include a link in the Helpful Discoveries section if anyone is interested.
Some of my most cherished reads so far include *“That Time I Reincarnated as a Slime”*—an entertaining blend of whims, adventure, and comedy and *“Heaven Official’s Blessing”*, which I would recommend only to those open to exploring LGBTQ literature, as it beautifully weaves themes of love and acceptance.<br>

#### Video Games
My taste in video games reflects my love for storytelling, as I primarily immerse myself in Fantasy and Adventure titles. I have a particular fondness for games that allow me to forge bonds with animal companions, such as *Palworld* and, of course, the beloved *Pokémon* series. Ironically, I've recently come to realize that turn-based video games and those with limited character customization are not quite to my liking, as I find them confining.  I say ironically because LITRPGS are essentially novels based in environments traditionally found in turn-based games. <br>


## Helpful Discoveries

[How to Create Mermaid Diagrams in GitLab]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ9QmuTHuSI&t=438s) In this case, I found the blind leading the blind to be extremely helpful. She’s also a beginner and so often uses more familiar terms when explaining her process to create her Mermaid Diagram <br>
[Novel Updates](https://www.novelupdates.com/) This is the source for Asian novels that I mentioned earlier. You won’t be able to see links for reading anything until after you create an account and sign in. If anyone else finds something similar, I’m always open to suggestions
